Red rose, how beautiful you are Gallantly bloom forever more Pale rose, may you never wither I will commit myself to you  If the sky shall shower down on you I will be the shelter through the rain If a storm shall carry hurt on you Let me be the shelter through the pain  One day when time goes by A day to crumble will pass on by Always I'll be by your side Forever and ever, right by your side  Now sleep tight and shine bright.
